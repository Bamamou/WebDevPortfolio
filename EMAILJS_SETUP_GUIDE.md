# EmailJS Setup Guide for Netlify

## Current Issue
Your contact form sends emails successfully but without the form data (name, email, subject, message). This is typically due to:
1. Environment variables not being set in Netlify
2. EmailJS template configuration mismatch
3. Build process not running correctly

## Step 1: Verify Netlify Environment Variables

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Click on your site
3. Go to **Site settings** â†’ **Environment variables**
4. Make sure you have these three variables set:
   - `EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID` = (your EmailJS service ID)
   - `EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID` = (your EmailJS template ID)  
   - `EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY` = (your EmailJS public key)

## Step 2: Check EmailJS Template Configuration

1. Go to [EmailJS Dashboard](https://www.emailjs.com)
2. Click on **Email Templates**
3. Edit your template
4. Make sure your template includes these variables:
   ```
   {{from_name}} - for the sender's name
   {{from_email}} - for the sender's email
   {{subject}} - for the email subject
   {{message}} - for the email message
   ```

## Step 3: Example EmailJS Template

Your EmailJS template should look something like this:

**Subject Line:**
```
{{subject}}
```

**Template Content:**
```
Hello,

You have received a new message from your portfolio website:

Name: {{from_name}}
Email: {{from_email}}
Subject: {{subject}}

Message:
{{message}}

Best regards,
Portfolio Contact Form
```

## Step 4: Test the Setup

1. After setting the environment variables in Netlify, trigger a new deployment
2. The build script will replace the placeholders with actual values
3. Test the contact form
4. Check the browser console for debugging information

## Step 5: Debugging Tips

1. **Check browser console** - Look for form data logs
2. **Check Netlify build logs** - Verify the build script ran successfully
3. **Test EmailJS directly** - Use EmailJS dashboard to send a test email
4. **Verify template variables** - Make sure field names match exactly

## Alternative: Direct Email Fallback

If EmailJS continues to have issues, the form now includes a fallback that directs users to email you directly at: bamamounicolas@gmail.com

## Quick Test

After deployment, if you see this message when submitting the form:
> "Configuration error: Please check environment variables setup"

It means the environment variables weren't properly replaced during build.
